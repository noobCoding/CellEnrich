* Testing Environment

1. Windows 10
2. R version 4.0
3. Rstudio 1.2.5042
4. Rtools 40

* This installation guide is written in latest version of R (4.0).

* Also some package needs **install from sources which needs compilation** and it needs proper version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed


* It's recommended to install `devtools`, `BiocManager` package first, to install following packages in Github / Bioconductor (not in CRAN).

```R
library(devtools)
library(BiocManager)
```
------

As noted in [README](https://github.com/unistbig/CellEnrich)

`CellEnrich` needs some packages to be installed before use it.

Bioconductor Packages

1. `SingleCellExperiment`
2. `scran`

```R
BiocManager::install('SingleCellExperiment')
BiocManager::install('scran')
```
Other Packages 

1. `waiter`
2. `ggbiplot`


```R
devtools::install_github('JohnCoene/waiter')
devtools::install_github('vqv/ggbiplot')

```

After install these 3 packages, 

running this Script will install most of dependent packages. 

```R
install_github('unistbig/CellEnrich')
library(CellEnrich)
```
